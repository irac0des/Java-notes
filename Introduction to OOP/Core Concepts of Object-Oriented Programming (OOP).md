Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) revolves around several core concepts that enhance code organization, reusability, and maintainability. Below are the primary concepts elaborated along with examples of their implementation in modern programming languages like Java:

1. **Objects and Classes**:
   - **Classes**: A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines attributes (data) and methods (behavior) that the objects created from the class will have.
     - **Example**: In Java, you can define a class `Car` as follows:
       ```java
       public class Car {
           private String color;
           private String model;

           public Car(String color, String model) {
               this.color = color;
               this.model = model;
           }

           public void displayInfo() {
               System.out.println("Model: " + model + ", Color: " + color);
           }
       }
       ```
   - **Objects**: An object is an instance of a class. Each object can hold different values for its attributes, allowing for unique behaviors.
     - **Example**:
       ```java
       Car myCar = new Car("Red", "Toyota");
       myCar.displayInfo();  // Output: Model: Toyota, Color: Red
       ```

2. **Abstraction**:
   - Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex reality while exposing only the necessary parts. It allows focusing on the interaction with the object without needing to know the details of its implementation.
   - **Example**: In Java, you can achieve abstraction using abstract classes and interfaces. An abstract class can provide a base with implemented methods while leaving other methods to be defined by subclasses.
     ```java
     public abstract class Animal {
         abstract void sound();  // Abstract method

         public void sleep() {  // Concrete method
             System.out.println("Sleeping");
         }
     }

     public class Dog extends Animal {
         @Override
         void sound() {
             System.out.println("Bark");
         }
     }
     ```

3. **Encapsulation**:
   - Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (behavior) that operate on the data into a single unit (class). It restricts direct access to some of the object's components, which is a means of preventing unintended interference and misuse.
   - **Example**: In the `Car` class, the fields `color` and `model` are private. They can only be accessed and modified through public methods (getters and setters).
     ```java
     public class Car {
         private String color;

         public String getColor() {
             return color;
         }

         public void setColor(String color) {
             this.color = color;
         }
     }
     ```

4. **Message Passing**:
   - Message passing refers to the way objects communicate with each other by sending messages. In OOP, a method call can be considered as a message sent to an object.
   - **Example**: Continuing from the `Car` example, when you call `myCar.displayInfo()`, you are sending a message to the `myCar` object to execute the `displayInfo` method.
     ```java
     myCar.displayInfo();  // The message "displayInfo" is sent to the myCar object
     ```

### Significance of OOP Concepts

- **Robustness**: By utilizing encapsulation and abstraction, OOP promotes a robust architecture that can handle errors more gracefully, as implementation details are hidden, and changes to the internal workings do not affect other parts of the program.
- **Maintainability**: Code is easier to maintain and extend due to its modular nature. You can modify or replace classes without affecting others, thanks to the principles of inheritance and polymorphism.
- **Reusability**: Once a class is defined, it can be reused across different programs or modules. This reduces redundancy and effort in coding, as well as fosters consistency in the codebase.
